# TorchServe Regression Tests

This folder contains nightly regression tests execututed against TorchServe master.These tests use [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for exercising all the Management & Inference APIs.

[Test Logs](https://torchserve-regression-test.s3.amazonaws.com/torch-serve-regression-test/tmp/test_exec.log)

### Running the test manually.

Clone Torch Serve Repo & Build the Docker Image for the execition env.

```
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/serve
cd serve
./build_image.sh
```

This would build a docker Image with a tag torchserve:1.0 in which we would run our Regression Tests.

```
docker run -it —user root torchserve:1.0 /bin/bash
```

In the Docker CLI execute the following tests.

```
apt-get update 
apt-get install -y git wget
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/serve
cd serve 
./test/regression_tests.sh
```

You can view the logs for Test execution & the Torch serve in the /tmp dir.

```
cat /tmp/test_exec.log
cat /tmp/ts.log 
```

### Adding tests

To add to the tests, import a collection (in /postman) to Postman and add new requests. Specifically to test for inference against a new model
* Open inference_api_test_collection.json in POST man.
* Clone an Register Model / Inferece Request combination.
* Update URL & Model Payload.

Afterwards, export the collection as a v2.1 collection and replace the existing exported collection.
To add a new suite of tests, add a new collection to /postman and update regression_tests.sh to run the new collection and buldsepc.yml to keep track of the report.
