Note: the following benchmarking suite requires an AWS setup, and is an expensive operation involving several high-compute ec2 instances.

This apache-bench based benchmark aims to do a multiple batch-size based inference benchmarking as per provided config in a *.yaml file. Each config represents one model.

Check out a sample vgg11 model config at the path: `tests/suite/vgg11.yaml`

### Setup

* Ensure you have access to an AWS account i.e. [setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) your environment such that awscli can access your account via either an IAM user or an IAM role. An IAM role is recommended for use with AWS. For the purposes of testing in your personal account, the following managed permissions should suffice: <br>
-- [AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess) <br>
-- [AmazonEC2FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess) <br>
-- [AmazonS3FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess) <br>
-- [AmazonIAMFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonIAMFullAccess) 
<br (or at the least iam:passrole).

* [Create](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.html) an ECR repository with the name “torchserve-benchmark” in the us-west-2 region, e.g.
```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name torchserve-benchmark --region us-west-2
```
If you'd like to use your own repo, edit the __init__.py under `serve/test/benchmark/tests/utils`
* Ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) client set-up on your system - osx/ec2
* Adjust the following global variables to your preference in the file `serve/test/benchmark/tests/utils/__init__.py` <br>
-- IAM_INSTANCE_PROFILE :this role is attached to all ec2 instances created as part of the benchmarking process. Create this as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#create-iam-role). Default role name is 'EC2Admin'.<br>
-- S3_BUCKET_BENCHMARK_ARTIFACTS :all temporary benchmarking artifacts including server logs will be stored in this bucket: <br>
-- DEFAULT_DOCKER_DEV_ECR_REPO :docker image used for benchmarking will be pushed to this repo <br>
* If you're running this setup on an EC2 instance, please ensure that the instance's security group settings 'allow' inbound ssh port 22. Refer [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html).

*The following steps assume that the current working directory is serve/.*

1. Create or use any python virtual environment
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv bvenv
source bvenv/bin/activate
```
2. Install requirements for the benchmarking 
```
pip install -r test/benchmark/requirements.txt
```
3. Make sure that you've setup AWS account correctly
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
4. For each of the test files under `test/benchmark/tests/`, e.g., test_vgg11.py, set the list of instance types you want to test on:
```
INSTANCE_TYPES_TO_TEST = ["p3.8xlarge"]
```
5. The automation scripts uses the ts-config from the following location: `benchmarks/config.properties`. Make changes to this file in the current local folder to use this across all the runs.
6. Finally, start the benchmark run as follows (run this a pseudo shell such as tmux or screen, as this is a long-running script):
```
python test/benchmark/run_benchmark.py
```
7. To start test for a particual model, modify the `pytest_args` list in run_benchmark.py to include `["-k", "vgg11"]`, if that particular model is vgg11
8. For generating benchmarking report, modify the argument to function `generate_comprehensive_report()` to point to the s3 bucket uri for the benchmark run. Run the script as:
```
python report.py
```
The final benchmark report will be available in markdown format as `report.md` in the `serve/` folder.
