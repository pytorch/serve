Project Description
===================

Torch Model Archiver is a tool used for creating archives of trained neural net models that can be consumed by TorchServe inference.

Use the Torch Model Archiver CLI to start create a ``.mar`` file.

Torch Model Archiver is part of `TS <https://pypi.org/project/torchserve/>`__.
However,you can install Torch Model Archiver stand alone.

Detailed documentation and examples are provided in the `README
<https://github.com/pytorch/serve/model-archiver/README.md>`__.
