# AMD Support

TorchServe can be run on any combination of operating system and device that is
[supported by ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/docs/compatibility.html).

## Supported Versions of ROCm

The current stable `major.patch` version of ROCm and the previous path version will be supported. For example version `N.2` and `N.1` where `N` is the current major version.

## Installation

  - Make sure you have **python >= 3.8 installed** on your system.
  - clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:pytorch/serve.git
    ```

  - cd into the cloned folder

    ```bash
    cd serve
    ```

  - create a virtual environment for python

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

  - activate the virtual environment. If you use another shell (fish, csh, powershell) use the relevant option in from `/venv/bin/`
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

  - install the dependencies needed for ROCm support.

    ```bash
    python ./ts_scripts/install_dependencies.py --rocm=rocm61
    python ./ts_scripts/install_from_src.py
    ```
  - enable amd-smi in the python virtual environment
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/rocm/share/amd_smi/
    pip install -e /opt/rocm/share/amd_smi/
    ```

### Selecting Accelerators Using `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`

If you have multiple accelerators on the system where you are running TorchServe you can select which accelerators should be visible to TorchServe
by setting the environment variable `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to a string of 0-indexed comma-separated integers representing the ids of the accelerators.

If you have 8 accelerators but only want TorchServe to see the last four of them do `export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,5,6,7`.

>ℹ️  **Not setting** `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` will cause TorchServe to use all available accelerators on the system it is running on.

> ⚠️  You can run into trouble if you set `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to an empty string.
> eg. `export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` or `export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`
> use `unset HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` if you want to remove its effect.

> ⚠️  Setting both `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` may cause unintended behaviour and should be avoided.
> Doing so may cause an exception in the future.

## Docker

**In Development**

`Dockerfile.rocm` provides preliminary ROCm support for TorchServe.

Building and running `dev-image`:

```bash
docker build --file docker/Dockerfile.rocm --target dev-image -t torch-serve-dev-image-rocm --build-arg USE_ROCM_VERSION=rocm62 --build-arg BUILD_FROM_SRC=true .

docker run -it --rm --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri torch-serve-dev-image-rocm bash
```

## Example Usage

After installing TorchServe with the required dependencies for ROCm you should be ready to serve your model.

For a simple example, refer to `serve/examples/image_classifier/mnist/`.
