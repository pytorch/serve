## Default Handlers

* [Image Classifier](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/ts/torch_handler/image_classifier.py) - This handler takes an image and returns the name of object in that image
* [Text Classifier](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/ts/torch_handler/text_classifier.py) - This handler takes a text (string) as input and returns the classification text based on the model vocabulary
* [Object Detector](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/ts/torch_handler/object_detector.py) - This handler takes an image and returns list of detected classes and bounding boxes respectively
* [Image Segmenter](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/ts/torch_handler/image_segmenter.py)- This handler takes an image and returns output shape as [CL H W], CL - number of classes, H - height and W - width

## Examples

* [HuggingFace Language Model](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/examples/Huggingface_Transformers/Transformer_handler_generalized.py) - This handler takes an input sentence and can return sequence classifications, token classifications or Q&A answers
* [Multi Modal Framework](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/examples/MMF-activity-recognition/handler.py) - Build and deploy a classifier that combines text, audio and video input data
* [Dual Translation Workflow](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/examples/Workflows/nmt_tranformers_pipeline) - 
* [Model Zoo](model_zoo.md) - List of pre-trained model archives ready to be served for inference with TorchServe.
