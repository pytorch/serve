# Logging on Torchserve

In this document we will go through logging mechanism in TorchServe. We will also go over how to modify the behavior of logging in model-server. Logging in TorchServe also covers
metrics, as metrics are logged into a file. To further understand how to customize metrics or define custom logging layouts, refer to the [metrics document](metrics.md)

# Pre-requisites
Before getting into this tutorials, you must familiarize yourself with log4j configuration properties. Refer to this online [document](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html)
on how to configure the log4j parameters. Similarly, familiarize yourself with the default [log4j.properties](../frontend/server/src/main/resources/log4j.properties) used by 
TorchServe. 

# Types of logs
Torchserve currently provides three types of logs.
1. Access Logs.
1. TorchServe Logs.

## Access Logs:
These logs collect the access pattern to Torchserve. The configuration pertaining to access logs are as follows,
```properties
log4j.logger.ACCESS_LOG = INFO, access_log


log4j.appender.access_log = org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.access_log.File = ${LOG_LOCATION}/access_log.log
log4j.appender.access_log.MaxFileSize = 100MB
log4j.appender.access_log.MaxBackupIndex = 5
log4j.appender.access_log.layout = org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.access_log.layout.ConversionPattern = %d{ISO8601} - %m%n
```

As defined in the properties file, the access logs are collected in {LOG_LOCATION}/access_log.log file. When we load the TorchServe
with a model and run inference against the server, the following logs are collected into the access_log.log
```text
2018-10-15 13:56:18,976 [INFO ] BackendWorker-9000 ACCESS_LOG - /127.0.0.1:64003 "POST /predictions/resnet-18 HTTP/1.1" 200 118
```
The above log tells us that a successful `POST` call to `/predictions/resnet-18` was made by remote host `127.0.0.1:64003` it took `118`ms to complete this request.

These logs are useful to determine the current performance of the model-server as well as understand the requests received by model-server.

## TorchServe Logs
These logs collect all the logs from TorchServe and from the backend workers (the custom model code).
The default configuration pertaining to ts logs are as follows:
```properties
log4j.logger.com.amazonaws.ml.ts = DEBUG, ts_log


log4j.appender.ts_log = org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.ts_log.File = ${LOG_LOCATION}/ts_log.log
log4j.appender.ts_log.MaxFileSize = 100MB
log4j.appender.ts_log.MaxBackupIndex = 5
log4j.appender.ts_log.layout = org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.ts_log.layout.ConversionPattern = %d{ISO8601} [%-5p] %t %c - %m%n
```

This configuration by default dumps all the logs above `DEBUG` level. 

### Generating and logging custom logs
As a user of TorchServe, you might want to log custom logs into the log files. This could be for debug purposes or
to log any errors. To accomplish this, simply print the required logs to `stdout/stderr`. TorchServe will capture the logs generated by the 
backend workers and log it into the log file. Some examples of logs are as follows

1. Messages printed to stderr 
```text
2018-10-14 16:46:51,656 [WARN ] W-9000-stderr org.pytorch.serve.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle - [16:46:51] src/nnvm/legacy_json_util.cc:209: Loading symbol saved by previous version v0.8.0. Attempting to upgrad\

2018-10-14 16:46:51,657 [WARN ] W-9000-stderr org.pytorch.serve.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle - [16:46:51] src/nnvm/legacy_json_util.cc:217: Symbol successfully upgraded!
```
 
1. Messages printed to stdout 
```text
2018-10-14 16:59:59,926 [INFO ] W-9000-stdout org.pytorch.serve.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle - preprocess time: 3.60
2018-10-14 16:59:59,926 [INFO ] W-9000-stdout org.pytorch.serve.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle - inference time: 117.31
2018-10-14 16:59:59,926 [INFO ] W-9000-stdout org.pytorch.serve.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle - postprocess time: 8.52
```

# Modifying the behavior of the logs
In order to modify the default behavior of the logging, you could define `log4j.properties` file. There are two ways of starting
TorchServe with custom logs

### Provide with config.properties
 Once you define custom `log4j.properties`, add this to the 
`config.properties` file as follows

```properties
vmargs=-Dlog4j.configuration=file:///path/to/custom/log4j.properties
```
Then start the TorchServe as follows
```bash
$ torchserve --start --model-store /models --ts-config /path/to/config.properties
```
### Provide with CLI 
Alternatively, you could start the TorchServe with the following command as well

```bash
$ torchserve --start --model-store /models --log-config /path/to/custom/log4j.properties
```

# Enable asynchronous logging
If your model is super lightweight and seeking for high throughput, you can consider enable asynchronous logging.
Note that log output maybe delayed and latest log might be lost if TorchServe is terminated unexpectedly.
asynchronous logging is disabled by default.
To enable asynchronous logging, add following property in `config.properties`:
 
```properties
async_logging=true
```
