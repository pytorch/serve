## PyTorch 2.x integration

PyTorch 2.0 brings more compiler options to PyTorch, for you that should mean better perf either in the form of lower latency or lower memory consumption. Integrating PyTorch 2.0 is fairly trivial but for now the support will be experimental given that most public benchmarks have focused on training instead of inference.

We strongly recommend you leverage newer hardware so for GPUs that would be an Ampere architecture. You'll get even more benefits from using server GPU deployments like A10G and A100 vs consumer cards. But you should expect to see some speedups for any Volta or Ampere architecture.

## Get started

Install torchserve and ensure that you're using at least `torch>=2.0.0`

```sh
python ts_scripts/install_dependencies.py --cuda=cu118
pip install torchserve torch-model-archiver
```

## torch.compile

PyTorch 2.0 supports several compiler backends and you pick which one you want by passing in an optional file `model_config.yaml` during your model packaging

```yaml
pt2: "inductor"
```

You can also pass a dictionary with compile options if you need more control over torch.compile:

```yaml
pt2 : {backend: inductor, mode: reduce-overhead}
```

As an example let's expand our getting started guide with the only difference being passing in the extra `model_config.yaml` file

```
mkdir model_store
torch-model-archiver --model-name densenet161 --version 1.0 --model-file ./serve/examples/image_classifier/densenet_161/model.py --export-path model_store --extra-files ./serve/examples/image_classifier/index_to_name.json --handler image_classifier --config-file model_config.yaml
torchserve --start --ncs --model-store model_store --models densenet161.mar
```

The exact same approach works with any other model, what's going on is the below

```python
# 1. Convert a regular module to an optimized module
opt_mod = torch.compile(mod)
# 2. Train the optimized module
# ....
# 3. Save the opt module state dict
torch.save(opt_model.state_dict(), "model.pt")

# 4. Reload the model
mod = torch.load(model)

# 5. Compile the module and then run inferences with it
opt_mod = torch.compile(mod)
```

torchserve takes care of 4 and 5 for you while the remaining steps are your responsibility. You can do the exact same thing on the vast majority of TIMM or HuggingFace models.

### Note

`torch.compile()` is a JIT compiler and JIT compilers generally have a startup cost. If that's an issue for you make sure to populate these two environment variables to improve your warm starts.

```
import os

os.environ["TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR"] = "1"
os.environ["TORCHINDUCTOR_FX_GRAPH_CACHE"] = "/path/to/directory"  # replace with your desired path
```

## torch.export.export

Export your model from a training script, keep in mind that an exported model cannot have graph breaks.

```python
import io
import torch

class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        return x + 10

ep = torch.export.export(MyModule(), (torch.randn(5),))

# Save to file
# torch.export.save(ep, 'exported_program.pt2')
extra_files = {'foo.txt': b'bar'.decode('utf-8')}
torch.export.save(ep, 'exported_program.pt2', extra_files=extra_files)

# Save to io.BytesIO buffer
buffer = io.BytesIO()
torch.export.save(ep, buffer)
```

Serve your exported model from a custom handler

```python
# from initialize()
ep = torch.export.load('exported_program.pt2')

with open('exported_program.pt2', 'rb') as f:
    buffer = io.BytesIO(f.read())
buffer.seek(0)
ep = torch.export.load(buffer)

# Make sure everything looks good
print(ep)
print(extra_files['foo.txt'])

# from inference()
print(ep(torch.randn(5)))
```
