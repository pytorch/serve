# Loading large Huggingface models with constrained resources using accelerate

This document briefs on serving large HG models with limited resource using accelerate. This option can be activated with `low_cpu_mem_usage=True`. The model is first created on the Meta device (with empty weights) and the state dict is then loaded inside it (shard by shard in the case of a sharded checkpoint).

### Step 1: Download model

Login into huggingface hub with token by running the below command

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```
paste the token generated from huggingface hub.

```bash
python Download_model.py --model_name bigscience/bloom-7b1
```
The script prints the path where the model is downloaded as below.

`model/models--bigscience-bloom-7b1/snapshots/5546055f03398095e385d7dc625e636cc8910bf2/`

The downloaded model is around 14GB.

### Step 2: Compress downloaded model

**_NOTE:_** Install Zip cli tool

Navigate to the path got from the above script. In this example it is

```bash
cd model/models--bigscience-bloom-7b1/snapshots/5546055f03398095e385d7dc625e636cc8910bf2/
zip -r /home/ubuntu/serve/examples/Huggingface_Largemodels//model.zip *
cd -

```

### Step 3: Generate MAR file

Navigate up to `Huggingface_Largemodels` directory.

```bash
torch-model-archiver --model-name bloom --version 1.0 --handler custom_handler.py --extra-files model.zip,setup_config.json -r requirements.txt
```

**__Note__**: Modifying setup_config.json
- Enable `low_cpu_mem_usage` to use accelerate
- Recommended `max_memory` in `setup_config.json` is the max size of shard.

### Step 4: Add the mar file to model store

```bash
mkdir model_store
mv bloom.mar model_store
```

### Step 5: Start torchserve

Update config.properties and start torchserve

```bash
torchserve --start --ncs --ts-config config.properties
```

### Step 5: Run inference

```bash
curl -v "http://localhost:8080/predictions/bloom" -T sample_text.txt
```
