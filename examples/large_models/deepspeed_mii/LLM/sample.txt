The museum format went through significant transformations in the 20th century. For a long time, museums collected the art of previous generations. The demonstration of contemporary art required new approaches and fresh ideas. Modernization attempts appeared most often in the design of the outer parts of buildings; museums received attractive exterior decoration, such as the glass pyramids of the Louvre. The museum was supposed to evoke a respectful attitude towards what was stored within its walls. That is why museums were arranged in palaces or in specially built buildings, the appearance of which was supposed to inspire respect. However, it gradually became clear that this approach did not attract modern visitors. It became apparent that contemporary art needed a contemporary place of expression.
