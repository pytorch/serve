# Each model can have multiple inputs
# Each input has a dtype, device and shape
# Some shapes can be arbitrary like a positive integer for batch size

# restnet.yaml
input:
  dtype: "float16" # Extend this to a list later, will need to print all permutations
  device: "cpu"
  shape: [-1, 3, 7, 7] # the first element is the batch size
  high : 10 # max value
  mode : "latency"
