        ===================
        
        TorchServe (PyTorch mdoel server) is a flexible and easy to use tool for
        serving deep learning models exported from `PyTorch <http://pytorch.org/>`__.
        
        Use the TorchServe CLI, or the pre-configured Docker images, to start a
        service that sets up HTTP endpoints to handle model inference requests.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        * **java 8**: Required. TorchServe use java to serve HTTP requests. You must install java 8 (or later) and make sure java is on available in $PATH environment variable *before* installing torchserve. If you have multiple java installed, you can use $JAVA_HOME environment vairable to control which java to use.
        * **PyTorch**: Required. Latest version of PyTorch will be installed as a part of TorchServe installation.
        
        For ubuntu:
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless
        
        
        For centos
        ::
