## ‚ö° Why TorchServe
* [Model Management API](docs/management_api.md): multi model management with optimized worker to model allocation
* [Inference API](docs/inference_api.md): REST and gRPC support for batched inference
* [TorchServe Workflows](examples/Workflows/README.md): deploy complex DAGs with multiple interdependent models
* Default way to serve PyTorch models in
  * [Kubeflow](https://v0-5.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pytorchserving/)
  * [MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-torchserve)
  * [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/serving-pytorch-models-in-production-with-the-amazon-sagemaker-native-torchserve-integration/)
  * [Kserve](https://kserve.github.io/website/0.8/modelserving/v1beta1/torchserve/): Supports both v1 and v2 API
  * [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/pytorch-google-cloud-how-deploy-pytorch-models-vertex-ai)
* Export your model for optimized inference. Torchscript out of the box, [ORT](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/deploying-onnx-model-with-torchserve/97725/2), [IPEX](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/examples/intel_extension_for_pytorch), [TensorRT](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/1243), [FasterTransformer](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/examples/FasterTransformer_HuggingFace_Bert)
* [Performance Guide](docs/performance_guide.md): builtin support to optimize, benchmark and profile PyTorch and TorchServe performance
* [Expressive handlers](CONTRIBUTING.md): An expressive handler architecture that makes it trivial to support inferencing for your usecase with [many supported out of the box](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/ts/torch_handler)
* [Metrics API](docs/metrics.md): out of box support for system level metrics with [Prometheus exports](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/examples/custom_metrics), custom metrics and PyTorch profiler support
