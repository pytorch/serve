# TorchServe

TorchServe is a flexible and easy to use tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in production.

Requires python > 3.8

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/predictions/bert -T input.txt
```
### üöÄ Quick start with TorchServe

```
# Install dependencies
# cuda is optional
python ./ts_scripts/install_dependencies.py --cuda=cu111

# Latest release
pip install torchserve torch-model-archiver torch-workflow-archiver

# Nightly build
pip install torchserve-nightly torch-model-archiver-nightly torch-workflow-archiver-nightly
```

### üê≥ Quick Start with Docker

```
docker pull pytorch/torchserve
```

Refer to [torchserve docker](docker/README.md) for details.

## ‚ö° Why TorchServe
* [Model Management API](docs/management_api.md): multi model management with optimized worker to model allocation
* [Inference API](docs/inference_api.md): REST and gRPC support for batched inference
* [TorchServe Workflows](examples/Workflows/README.md): deploy complex DAGs with multiple interdependent models
* Default way to serve PyTorch models in
  * [Kubeflow](https://v0-5.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pytorchserving/)
